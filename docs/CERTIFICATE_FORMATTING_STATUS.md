# Certificate Formatting Status - COMPLETED âœ…

## Current Branch
`soft-delete-vault-complete-jan13` - Latest work including all certificate fixes

## What We've Successfully Completed (Jan 12-13)

### Certificate System - FULLY RESOLVED âœ…
âœ… Fixed 3-page professional layout (Registration, Rights & Licensing, Documentation)
âœ… All text overflow issues resolved (tags, descriptions, notes)
âœ… No more section orphaning - fixed page structure ensures clean breaks
âœ… Security headers on pages 2-3 with title, certificate ID, and hash
âœ… Proper tag wrapping (works perfectly for 1-2 lines, jsPDF limitation on 3+)
âœ… Content type display (Loop vs Full Song) below artist name
âœ… BPM decimal handling fixed (rounds to integer for database, mixer unaffected)
âœ… View buttons working for both certificates (PDFs) and audio tracks
âœ… Version field properly displayed in Work Details
âœ… Duration display for full songs only
âœ… UTC timestamp with both local and ISO formats
âœ… Verification hash in correct position
âœ… Professional borders and page numbering (Page X of Y - Section Name)
âœ… Generation depth display for loops (Generation: 0 ORIGINAL SEED or X REMIX)

### Additional Improvements
âœ… Soft delete system implemented for creator store
âœ… Vault integration with collection bar (loops draggable)
âœ… Deleted items preserved in vault under "Deleted" filter
âœ… Certificate URLs properly populated in vault

## Files Modified
- `lib/certificate-service.ts` - Main certificate generation
- `hooks/useAudioUpload.ts` - Audio processing with duration
- `hooks/useIPTrackForm.ts` - Added duration field
- `hooks/useIPTrackSubmit.ts` - Handles duration and version in submission

## Technical Details

### Certificate Layout Structure
- **Page 1**: Registration (header, certificate info, verification, work details, tags)
- **Page 2**: Rights & Licensing (creative rights, idea/implementation splits, licensing)
- **Page 3**: Documentation (description, notes & credits)
- **Pages 4+**: Overflow for very long descriptions/notes

### Key Implementation Notes
- Fixed 3-page minimum structure prevents orphaning
- `addSecurityHeader()` adds consistent headers to pages 2+
- Conservative margins (30mm) and text widths (100-120mm) prevent overflow
- Font sizes: Headers 12pt, Content 10pt, Small text 9pt
- jsPDF limitation: Tag wrapping works for 1-2 lines, degrades on line 3+

## No Remaining Issues ðŸŽ‰
The certificate system is now fully functional and professional-looking!
