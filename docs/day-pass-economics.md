# Day Pass Economics

How creators earn from playlist streaming on mixmi.

---

## How It Works

1. **Listener buys a Day Pass** for $1 USDC
2. **24 hours of unlimited streaming** - full songs, no 20-second previews
3. **Every play is logged** - even repeats count as separate plays
4. **Revenue distributed** to creators based on play credits

---

## Credit System

Not all content is equal - songs take more effort than loops. Credits balance this:

| Content Type | Credits per Play | Why |
|--------------|------------------|-----|
| Full Song | 5 credits | Full production, longer duration |
| EP Track | 5 credits | Same as song |
| Loop Pack (per track) | 5 credits | Treated as short song |
| Single Loop | 1 credit | Short, often used as samples |

**Your earnings = (Your credits ÷ Total credits) × $1**

---

## Example: How Revenue Splits

A listener buys a day pass and plays:
- Your song 3 times (15 credits)
- 5 other songs once each (25 credits)
- 10 loops (10 credits)

**Total credits: 50**

**Your share: 15 ÷ 50 = 30% → $0.30**

If your song has collaborators with 50/50 split, you each get $0.15.

## Realistic Earnings: 4-Hour Listening Session

Most listeners stream 2-4 hours, not 24. Here's what 4 hours looks like:

### Scenario A: Song-Heavy Listener
| Plays | Credits | Per-Song Payout |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| ~68 songs | 340 | **$0.015/play** |

### Scenario B: Loop-Heavy Listener
| Plays | Credits | Per-Loop Payout |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| ~720 loops | 720 | **$0.0014/play** |

### Scenario C: Mixed (Realistic)
| Content | Plays | Credits |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Songs | 40 | 200 |
| Loops | 200 | 200 |
| **Total** | 240 | 400 |

**Per-song payout: $0.0025** (comparable to Spotify)
**Per-loop payout: $0.0005**

## Comparison to Streaming Platforms

| Platform | Per-Stream (Songs) |
|----------|-------------------|
| Spotify | $0.003 - $0.005 |
| Apple Music | $0.007 - $0.01 |
| YouTube Music | $0.002 - $0.004 |
| **mixmi (4hr session)** | **$0.015** |
| **mixmi (24hr worst case)** | **$0.0024** |

**Key insight:** Even in the worst case (24-hour marathon), mixmi pays comparably to Spotify. In realistic usage, mixmi pays **3-5x better**.

## Why Day Pass Over Subscription?

| Subscription Model | Day Pass Model |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Monthly commitment | Pay when you want |
| Complex revenue pools | Direct play-to-payment |
| Delayed payouts | Near-instant distribution |
| Platform keeps unused value | Listener gets full value |

The day pass is **listener-friendly** (no commitment) and **creator-friendly** (direct attribution).

---

## Repeat Plays = More Money

Unlike some platforms that cap or discount repeats:

- **Play a song 10 times?** Creator gets paid 10 times
- **Listener obsessed with your loop pack?** Every track, every play counts
- **Playlist on repeat overnight?** All those plays are logged

This rewards creators who make music people actually want to hear again.

---

## Revenue Distribution Timeline

1. **During pass:** Plays are logged in real-time
2. **Pass expires:** System calculates credit totals
3. **Distribution:** Payments sent to creator wallets
4. **Splits honored:** Collaborators get their share automatically

---

## Maximizing Your Earnings

### For Song Creators
- Full songs earn 5x the credits of loops
- Longer engagement = more repeat potential
- Quality > quantity (listeners repeat good songs)

### For Loop Creators
- Loop packs treated like songs (5 credits per track)
- Single loops earn less but can go viral in mixes
- Consider bundling loops into packs

### For Everyone
- Repeats count - make music people want to replay
- Collaborations split automatically
- All plays logged transparently

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone buys a pass and barely listens?**
A: Fewer total plays = higher payout per play for those who were played.

**Q: Do previews (20-second clips) count?**
A: No. Only full plays during an active day pass are logged for revenue.

**Q: What about radio stations?**
A: Currently not included in day pass. Radio has its own model (coming soon).

**Q: Can I see my day pass earnings?**
A: Yes, in your creator dashboard under "Streaming Revenue" (coming soon).

**Q: When do I get paid?**
A: Distributions happen when passes expire, with payments sent to your wallet.
