# AI Attribution Patterns

## Core Principles

AI is a contributor type like any other, but with unique considerations around agency, compensation, and transparency.

## The Attribution Question

### When Is AI a Tool vs Contributor?

**AI as Tool** (no attribution needed):
- Spell check
- Auto-tune
- Basic mixing
- Format conversion
- Simple enhancements

**AI as Contributor** (attribution appropriate):
- Generating melodies
- Writing lyrics
- Creating arrangements
- Producing beats
- Designing visuals

**The Test**: Could a human have been hired to do this specific creative work?

### How Much Attribution?

This is human judgment, not calculation:

**Minimal AI Use** (5-10%):
- AI suggested a few lines
- AI provided reference tracks
- AI helped with one transition

**Substantial AI Use** (20-40%):
- AI generated the melody
- AI wrote half the lyrics
- AI created the beat

**Primary AI Creation** (50-80%):
- AI generated most content
- Human curated and refined
- Human provided prompts and direction

## Revenue Models

### Current Model: Humans Keep Revenue

Since humans pay for AI tools:
- Attribution is informational
- Revenue stays with human creators
- AI contribution noted for transparency
- No double payment (subscription + revenue share)

### Future Models

**Model 1: AI Treasury**
- AI percentage goes to platform treasury
- Funds development and infrastructure
- Supports community projects

**Model 2: AI Developer Fund**
- Portions go to AI companies
- Incentivizes better creative tools
- Negotiated per platform

**Model 3: Redistribution**
- AI portion redistributed to human creators
- Rewards human creativity
- Equalizes AI advantage

**Model 4: AI Wallets** (speculative)
- AI agents have their own wallets
- Can own and trade attribution
- Autonomous creative entities
- Far future scenario

## Training Permission Patterns

### Permission Levels

**No Training**
- Hard boundary
- Content cannot be used for AI training
- Enforced technically where possible

**Academic Only**
- Research purposes permitted
- No commercial training
- Citations required

**Training with Attribution**
- AI models must attribute source
- Creators get credit in model cards
- Transparency required

**Training with Payment**
- Negotiated fee per use
- Recurring or one-time
- Premium for unique content

**Open Training**
- No restrictions
- Gift to commons
- Advancement of technology

### The Value Hierarchy

**Most Valuable for Training**:
- Unique cultural content
- Underrepresented styles
- Edge cases and outliers
- High-quality labeled data

**Moderately Valuable**:
- Regional variations
- Personal styles
- Niche genres
- Clean recordings

**Less Valuable**:
- Common patterns
- Already well-represented
- AI-generated content
- Poor quality recordings

## Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern 1: AI as Lyricist

**Human Prompt**: "Write verses about loss and hope"
**AI Output**: Generated lyrics
**Human Edit**: Selects, refines, arranges

**Attribution**:
- Lyrics: Human 60%, AI 40%
- Music: Human 100%
- Overall: Human 80%, AI 20%

### Pattern 2: AI as Composer

**Human Prompt**: Humming a melody
**AI Output**: Full orchestration
**Human Edit**: Adjusts arrangement

**Attribution**:
- Melody: Human 70%, AI 30%
- Arrangement: AI 80%, Human 20%
- Overall: Depends on weight of each

### Pattern 3: AI as Producer

**Human Input**: Raw vocals and guitar
**AI Process**: Full production, mixing, mastering
**Human Edit**: Final tweaks

**Attribution**:
- Songwriting: Human 100%
- Production: AI 70%, Human 30%
- Overall: Human 65%, AI 35%

### Pattern 4: Iterative Collaboration

**Back and Forth**:
- Human creates base
- AI generates variations
- Human selects and combines
- AI refines
- Human finalizes

**Attribution**: 50/50 (true collaboration)

## Transparency Patterns

### In Metadata
```
AI_Contributors: [
  {
    tool: "Claude",
    version: "3.5",
    contribution: "Lyrics assistance",
    percentage: 20
  },
  {
    tool: "Suno",
    version: "V3",
    contribution: "Melody generation",
    percentage: 30
  }
]
```

### In Display
- Show AI icon when AI contributed
- Percentage on hover
- Details in track info
- Clear in attribution chain

### In Licensing
- "Contains AI-generated content"
- "Human-curated AI collaboration"
- "AI training permissions: Academic only"

## Ethical Considerations

### The Transparency Imperative

Audiences deserve to know:
- When AI was involved
- How much AI contributed
- Which AI tools were used
- Whether content trains AI

### The Attribution Incentive

Why declare AI use:
- Builds trust with audience
- Legal protection
- Community norms emerging
- Platform benefits (promotion, tools)
- Historical documentation

### The Cultural Impact

AI attribution helps us understand:
- How human creativity evolves with AI
- Which communities adopt AI tools
- How different cultures use AI
- The human/AI creativity balance

## Edge Cases

### Multiple AIs
When multiple AI tools contribute:
- List each separately
- Combine if minimal (<5% each)
- Show primary AI contributor
- Maintain tool diversity info

### AI Remixing AI
- Original AI attributions carry forward
- New AI adds its layer
- Humans maintain curatorial credit
- Complexity tracked but simplified in display

### AI Curation
If AI selects/arranges human content:
- AI gets curatorial credit (20%)
- Original humans keep creation credit (80%)
- Similar to human DJ model

## Community Norms Evolution

### Current Norms Emerging
- Transparency valued over hiding
- AI as collaborator not replacement
- Human curation remains valuable
- Attribution without shame

### Future Norm Possibilities
- AI collaboration badges as prestige
- Separate categories for AI/human
- Hybrid works as own genre
- AI literacy as creative skill

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start Simple**: Binary (AI used: yes/no)
2. **Add Percentage**: Rough attribution
3. **Specify Tools**: Which AI contributed
4. **Detail Contribution**: What each did
5. **Enable Permissions**: Training controls

## The Long View

AI attribution in creative works is like:
- Photo editing software attribution in photography
- Sample attribution in hip-hop
- Software attribution in electronic music

It starts controversial, becomes normal, eventually invisible except when relevant.

The key: Build infrastructure now that can evolve with community norms rather than forcing particular view of AI collaboration.
