# CC#14 Investigation Brief - Carousel Drag Performance

## 🎯 **MISSION: Fix slow carousel → deck/crate dragging**

### **Problem Statement**
- ✅ **Carousel loads fast** (clustering works great)
- ❌ **Dragging FROM carousel is slow** (bottleneck identified)  
- ✅ **Other drag operations work well** (globe cards, search results)

**Specific issue:** When users drag tracks from Seattle cluster carousel (19 tracks) to mixer decks or crate, there's significant loading delay.

---

## 🕵️ **INVESTIGATION TASKS**

### **Phase 1: Component Identification**
1. **Find carousel component** - Likely in `/components/globe/` or `/app/page.tsx`
2. **Check if Seattle cluster uses GlobeTrackCard** instead of CompactTrackCardWithFlip
3. **Identify drag source** for carousel tracks vs regular globe tracks

### **Phase 2: Performance Analysis**  
1. **Compare drag implementations** between:
   - Regular globe cards (fast)
   - Carousel cluster cards (slow)
2. **Check image optimization** - Are carousel cards getting optimized images?
3. **Console debugging** - Look for missing "Globe card being dragged with optimization"

### **Phase 3: Apply Fix**
1. **Add image optimization** to carousel component (same pattern as CC13)
2. **Apply format:** `${imageUrl}?t=${Date.now()}&w=64&h=64`
3. **Test performance** improvement

## 📁 **KEY FILES TO INVESTIGATE**

### **Carousel Components**
- `/app/page.tsx` - Main globe page with cluster handling
- `/components/globe/Globe.tsx` - 3D globe component
- `/components/cards/GlobeTrackCard.tsx` - Possible carousel card component
- `/lib/globe/simpleCluster.tsx` - Clustering logic

### **Working Drag Implementation (for reference)**
- `/components/cards/CompactTrackCardWithFlip.tsx` - Line 45-60 (CC13's optimization)

### **Current Architecture**
- `/components/mixer/compact/*` - All mixer components (working)
- `/components/shared/Crate.tsx` - Crate component (working)
- `/contexts/MixerContext.tsx` - State management (working)

---

## 🔍 **SPECIFIC THINGS TO CHECK**

### **Console Debugging**
1. When dragging from carousel, look for:
   - `🌍 Globe card being dragged with optimization:` (CC13's log)
   - If missing, carousel uses different component
2. Check `imageUrl` in conversion logs:
   - Should have `?t=...&w=64&h=64` optimization
   - If not, optimization isn't being applied

### **Component Analysis**
1. **How does carousel render tracks?**
   - Same CompactTrackCardWithFlip as regular globe?
   - Different GlobeTrackCard component?
   - Custom carousel-specific component?

2. **Drag source comparison:**
   - Regular globe: Uses CompactTrackCardWithFlip (optimized by CC13)
   - Carousel: Uses ??? (needs optimization)

---

## 💡 **SOLUTION PATTERN**

**Follow CC13's optimization pattern from CompactTrackCardWithFlip:**

```typescript
// In the carousel drag source component
item: () => {
  // Optimize image for small displays when dragging
  const originalImageUrl = track.cover_image_url || (track as any).imageUrl;
  const optimizedTrack = {
    ...track,
    imageUrl: originalImageUrl 
      ? `${originalImageUrl}?t=${Date.now()}&w=64&h=64`
      : originalImageUrl,
    cover_image_url: originalImageUrl
      ? `${originalImageUrl}?t=${Date.now()}&w=64&h=64`  
      : originalImageUrl,
    audioUrl: track.audio_url
  };
  
  console.log('🎠 Carousel track being dragged with optimization:', optimizedTrack);
  return { track: optimizedTrack };
},
```

---

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Performance Goals**
- ✅ **Fast carousel dragging** - Should match regular globe card speed
- ✅ **Optimized images** - Console shows URLs with `?t=...&w=64&h=64`
- ✅ **No loading delays** - Smooth drag → drop → immediate display

### **Verification Tests**
1. **Drag from Seattle cluster** → mixer deck (should be fast)
2. **Drag from Seattle cluster** → crate (should be instant)
3. **Console logging** - Should see optimization logs
4. **Network tab** - Should see 64px image requests, not full-size

## 🤝 **COORDINATION WITH CC13**

**CC13 Role:** Project manager and architecture guide
**CC14 Role:** Performance specialist and carousel expert

**Communication:**
- Share findings about which component carousel uses
- Confirm optimization pattern works for carousel context
- Test performance improvements together

---

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS**

### **Working Perfectly**
- ✅ Globe cards → All destinations (fast)
- ✅ Search results → All destinations (fast)  
- ✅ Modal tracks → All destinations (fast)
- ✅ Crate management (fast)
- ✅ Mixer functionality (fast)

### **Needs Investigation**
- ❌ Carousel → Deck/Crate (slow - your mission!)

### **Architecture Ready**
- All state management working
- All drag/drop infrastructure in place  
- All components integrated
- Just need carousel performance optimization
