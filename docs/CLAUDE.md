# CLAUDE.md - Mixmi Alpha Uploader

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Mixmi Alpha Uploader repository.

## Project Overview

**Mixmi Alpha Uploader** is a standalone Next.js application for alpha content migration, built separately from the main Mixmi app to avoid production environment issues. It provides a complete loop pack upload system with 3-way content selection (Song | Loop | Loop Pack).

## üé® **Recent Major Improvements (January 2025)**

### **Authentication & User System**
- **Unified Sign-In Modal**: Combined alpha invite code and approved wallet authentication in single modal
- **Stacks Wallet Integration**: Full wallet connection with signature verification (not just address input)
- **Editable User Profiles**: Authenticated users can edit display name, tagline, and profile image
- **Editable Creator Stores**: Store owners can manage their content, add/remove tracks, edit metadata

### **Content Navigation & Linking**
- **Smart Card Linking**: Track cards link to creator stores, artist names link to profiles
- **Username/Wallet Routing**: Automatic routing to `/store/{username}` or `/profile/{username}` with fallback to wallet addresses
- **TrackDetailsModal Enhancement**: Added linked title and artist at top of modal matching card behavior

### **Loop Pack & EP Expansion System**
**Globe/Store Cards (Vertical Expansion):**
- Chevron button (color-coded: purple for loop packs, cream for EPs) on right side of card
- Vertical dropdown drawer below card showing draggable track rows
- Each row: numbered badge, BPM, play/pause button
- Smooth slideDown animation with 28px compact rows
- Individual tracks draggable to crate or mixer (loops only for mixer)

**Crate Cards (Horizontal Expansion):**
- Chevron button with dark semi-transparent background for visibility
- Horizontal slide-out to the right showing 64px draggable cards
- Numbered badges, BPM, hover interactions (play, add to cart)
- Maintains horizontal alignment in crate scroll area
- Playing indicators and smooth slideInRight animation

### **Mixer Improvements**
- **Purple Loop Theme**: Changed from cyan to loop purple (#9772F4) for all deck states
- **Educational Error Messages**: Context-specific guidance when wrong content type dropped:
  - Loop packs/EPs: Instructs to use chevron expansion
  - Songs: Redirects to crate
  - Messages persist 5 seconds for readability
- **Deck Labels**: Changed "Load Track" to "Load Loop" for clarity

### **UI Polish**
- **Icon Standardization**: Consistent close button styling across crate and deck cards
- **Card Simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexity, improved hover states
- **Image Optimization**: Maintained throughout expansion features

## üîê **Alpha Code to Wallet Mapping System (Sept 17, 2025)**

**Critical Architecture:** Separates user-friendly authentication from blockchain operations

### **The Challenge**
- **Authentication:** Users need friendly invite codes (`MIXMI-ABC123`) to avoid security scanner warnings
- **Blockchain:** Creative splits require actual Stacks wallet addresses (`SP1234...XYZ`) for payment operations
- **UI Security:** Cannot expose wallet addresses in forms (triggers security violations)

### **The Solution: Dual-Layer System**

**üé´ Authentication Layer (User-Facing):**
- Users authenticate with alpha invite codes (`MIXMI-ABC123`)
- UI displays alpha codes for user recognition
- Forms avoid "wallet" terminology (uses "authenticated account", "access code")
- Security scanners see no suspicious wallet address collection

**üîó Blockchain Layer (Backend):**
- API endpoint `/api/auth/resolve-wallet` converts alpha codes ‚Üí wallet addresses
- Creative splits always receive real wallet addresses for payment operations
- Database stores mapping between invite codes and wallet addresses
- Automatic conversion ensures blockchain compatibility

### **Implementation Components**

**Files:** `lib/auth/wallet-mapping.ts`, `app/api/auth/resolve-wallet/route.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `getWalletFromAuthIdentity()` - Server-side alpha code ‚Üí wallet conversion
- `isValidStacksAddress()` - Validates SP/SM address format
- `isAlphaCode()` - Detects MIXMI-ABC123 format

**Form Behavior:**
- **"Use authenticated account" checkbox** - Shows alpha code in UI, auto-fills with real wallet
- **Manual collaborator fields** - Validate and require actual wallet addresses  
- **Error handling** - Clear guidance when wrong format used

### **Security Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **No wallet addresses in UI** (eliminates security scanner warnings)
- ‚úÖ **User-friendly authentication** with memorable invite codes
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain compatibility** with proper address handling
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatibility** supports both alpha codes and direct wallet addresses

**This system enables secure, user-friendly authentication while maintaining full blockchain functionality.**

## üîó **CRITICAL: Main App Integration Context**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is an ALPHA UPLOADER, not the full Mixmi app!**

**Main Mixmi App (in local development) includes:**
1. **üéõÔ∏è Tiny mixer** that floats over the globe for real-time content mixing
2. **üì¶ Persistent crate** at bottom that transports content between app sections with purchase flow
3. **üè™ Content Creator Stores** with individual creator vaults and certificates  
4. **üë§ User profile pages** with complex social and content management features
5. **üîÑ Inter-component interactions** between globe, mixer, crate, stores, and profiles

**Integration Considerations:**
- **Component portability**: Alpha components will be ported to main app
- **State management**: Alpha uses simple state, main app has complex multi-context system  
- **Authentication**: Alpha uses wallet whitelist, main app uses full Stacks Connect
- **Data flow**: Alpha is upload-focused, main app has complex user interactions
- **UI consistency**: Components must work with main app's layout and floating elements

**This alpha uploader serves as a testing ground and component laboratory for features that will eventually integrate into the main Mixmi application ecosystem.**
