# Remix System - Authoritative Guide (October 2025)

**This document is the single source of truth for how Mixmi's Gen 1 remix system works.**

---

## Core Principles

### 1. IP Attribution (What You Own)
**Each source loop contributes 50% to the remix's IP ownership.**

- Loop A creators own **50%** of the remix
- Loop B creators own **50%** of the remix
- **Remixer is NOT an IP owner** - they are a reseller/distributor

### 2. Payment Flow (How Money Flows)
**Two separate payment events:**

**A) Creating a Remix (Upfront Licensing):**
- Remixer pays **1 STX per loop** to loop creators
- Payment goes directly to original creators via smart contract
- This is a LICENSE FEE to create the derivative work

**B) Selling a Remix (Commission Split):**
- Remixer gets **20% commission** (distributor fee)
- Original creators get **80%** (IP holder revenue)
- Split according to their 50/50 IP ownership

## Detailed Example: Grace Remixes Two Loops

### The Source Loops

**Loop A - "Drums"**
- Composer: Alice (100%)
- Producer: Amy (100%)
- Price: 1 STX

**Loop B - "Bass"**
- Composer: Bob (100%)
- Producer: Betty (100%)
- Price: 1 STX

### Step 1: Grace Creates the Remix

**Action:** Grace loads both loops into the mixer and records an 8-bar remix

**Payment (Upfront Licensing):**
```
Grace pays 2 STX total ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1 STX ‚Üí Loop A creators
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Composition (0.5 STX): Alice 100% = 0.5 STX
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (0.5 STX): Amy 100% = 0.5 STX
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1 STX ‚Üí Loop B creators
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Composition (0.5 STX): Bob 100% = 0.5 STX
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (0.5 STX): Betty 100% = 0.5 STX
```

**Result:** Grace has paid for the license to create a derivative work.

### Step 2: IP Attribution is Recorded

**The remix is now registered with these IP splits:**

**Composition Rights (100% pie):**
- Alice: 50% (from Loop A)
- Bob: 50% (from Loop B)

**Production Rights (100% pie):**
- Amy: 50% (from Loop A)
- Betty: 50% (from Loop B)

**Grace's Role:**
- NOT listed as IP holder
- Listed as "remixer" (creator/distributor)
- Will receive commission on sales

### Step 3: Someone Buys Grace's Remix

**Buyer pays 2 STX for the remix:**

```
2 STX purchase ‚Üí
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grace (remixer commission): 20% √ó 2 = 0.4 STX
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IP Holders (80% revenue): 80% √ó 2 = 1.6 STX
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Alice (25% of total): 0.4 STX
    ‚îÇ   (50% comp √ó 50% weight = 25% of IP revenue)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Amy (25% of total): 0.4 STX
    ‚îÇ   (50% prod √ó 50% weight = 25% of IP revenue)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bob (25% of total): 0.4 STX
    ‚îÇ   (50% comp √ó 50% weight = 25% of IP revenue)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Betty (25% of total): 0.4 STX
        (50% prod √ó 50% weight = 25% of IP revenue)
```

**Total Revenue Distribution:**
- Grace earned: 0.4 STX (20% commission)
- Original creators earned: 1.6 STX (80% split equally)

## Mathematical Formulas

### IP Attribution Formula

For a Gen 1 remix using Loop A and Loop B:

**Composition Split:**
```
For each composer in Loop A:
  Remix Composition % = (Loop A Composition %) √ó 50%

For each composer in Loop B:
  Remix Composition % = (Loop B Composition %) √ó 50%

Total must equal 100%
```

**Production Split:**
```
For each producer in Loop A:
  Remix Production % = (Loop A Production %) √ó 50%

For each producer in Loop B:
  Remix Production % = (Loop B Production %) √ó 50%

Total must equal 100%
```

### Sale Revenue Formula

When a remix sells for price P:

```
Remixer Commission = P √ó 20%
IP Holder Pool = P √ó 80%

For each IP holder:
  Payment = IP Holder Pool √ó (holder's IP percentage)
```

**Example:** 2 STX sale with 4 equal IP holders (25% each)
```
Remixer: 2 √ó 20% = 0.4 STX
Each IP holder: (2 √ó 80%) √ó 25% = 0.4 STX
```

## Complex Example: Multiple Collaborators

### Source Loops with Multiple Contributors

**Loop A - "Drums"**
- Composer 1: Alice (60%)
- Composer 2: Charlie (40%)
- Producer: Amy (100%)
- Price: 1 STX

**Loop B - "Bass"**
- Composer: Bob (100%)
- Producer 1: Betty (70%)
- Producer 2: Diana (30%)
- Price: 1 STX

### Remix IP Attribution

**Composition (100%):**
- Alice: 30% (60% of Loop A √ó 50%)
- Charlie: 20% (40% of Loop A √ó 50%)
- Bob: 50% (100% of Loop B √ó 50%)

**Production (100%):**
- Amy: 50% (100% of Loop A √ó 50%)
- Betty: 35% (70% of Loop B √ó 50%)
- Diana: 15% (30% of Loop B √ó 50%)

### When Remix Sells for 3 STX

**Remixer (Grace):**
- Commission: 3 √ó 20% = 0.6 STX

**IP Holders (2.4 STX pool):**

*Composition contributors (50% weight):*
- Alice: 2.4 √ó (30% √∑ 2) = 0.36 STX
- Charlie: 2.4 √ó (20% √∑ 2) = 0.24 STX
- Bob: 2.4 √ó (50% √∑ 2) = 0.6 STX

*Production contributors (50% weight):*
- Amy: 2.4 √ó (50% √∑ 2) = 0.6 STX
- Betty: 2.4 √ó (35% √∑ 2) = 0.42 STX
- Diana: 2.4 √ó (15% √∑ 2) = 0.18 STX

**Verification:**
0.6 (Grace) + 0.36 + 0.24 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.42 + 0.18 = 3 STX ‚úÖ

## Code Implementation

### Current Files (October 2025)

**IP Attribution Logic:**
- **File:** `lib/calculateRemixSplits.ts`
- **Function:** `calculateRemixSplits(loopA, loopB)`
- **Returns:** Composition and production splits for the remix
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Fully implemented and tested

**Testing:**
- **File:** `scripts/test-remix-splits.ts`
- **Command:** `npm run test:remix-splits`
- **Coverage:** 4 scenarios including edge cases
- **Status:** ‚úÖ All tests passing

**Display:**
- **File:** `components/modals/TrackDetailsModal.tsx`
- **Shows:** Grouped splits by source loop with scaling explanation
- **Example:** "Alice: 100% ‚Üí 50% of remix"

---

## Payment Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Currently Working

**Creating Remixes (Upfront Payment):**
- Remixer pays 1 STX per loop
- Uses existing `music-payment-splitter-v3` smart contract
- Payments distributed to all composition/production contributors
- **Status:** Live on Stacks mainnet since October 7, 2025

**Remix Pricing:**
- `download_price_stx` = sum of both loop download prices
- If loops don't allow downloads, field is null
- Price displayed in UI when viewing remix

### üöß Not Yet Implemented

**Downstream Remix Sales:**
- When customer buys a remix download
- 20% commission to remixer
- 80% to IP holders via smart contract
- **Planned:** API-based implementation for alpha
- **Future:** Could move to dedicated smart contract

---

## Edge Cases & Rules

### Remixer Can Also Be a Contributor

**Scenario:** Grace remixes her own loop with someone else's loop

**IP Attribution:**
- If Grace created Loop A (100% comp, 100% prod)
- And remixes with Loop B (Bob 100% comp, Betty 100% prod)
- Grace appears in IP splits: 50% comp, 50% prod
- Grace ALSO gets 20% commission on sales

**Result:** Grace gets paid twice - as IP holder AND as remixer

### Wallet Consolidation

**Scenario:** Same person has multiple roles across loops

**Example:**
- Loop A: Alice composer, Alice producer
- Loop B: Alice composer, Bob producer

**Remix attribution:**
- Alice appears once with consolidated percentage
- Not listed twice even though in multiple roles

**Code handles this:** `calculateRemixSplits()` merges duplicate wallets

### Rounding Adjustments

**Issue:** Percentages may not sum to exactly 100% due to rounding

**Solution:** Code adjusts largest contributor to ensure 100% total

**Example:**
- Raw calculation: 33.33% + 33.33% + 33.33% = 99.99%
- Adjusted: 33.34% + 33.33% + 33.33% = 100% ‚úÖ

## Terminology Clarification

### ‚ùå Avoid Confusing Terms

**"80/20 Split"** - Too ambiguous! Could mean:
- IP ownership? (NO - it's 50/50 from each loop)
- Payment split? (YES - for sales revenue)

**Better terminology:**
- "50/50 IP contribution" (each loop contributes half)
- "20% remixer commission" (on sales)
- "80% IP holder revenue" (on sales)

### ‚úÖ Clear Terms to Use

**IP Attribution:**
- Each loop contributes 50%
- Equal contribution model
- IP ownership by original creators

**Payment Flow:**
- Upfront licensing: 1 STX per loop
- Sales commission: 20% to remixer
- IP revenue: 80% to creators

**Roles:**
- IP Holder: Original loop creator
- Remixer: Derivative work creator/distributor
- Buyer: Customer purchasing the remix

---

## Future: Gen 2+ Remixes

**Current Status:** Gen 1 only (original loop + original loop)

**Future Challenge:** What happens when someone remixes a remix?

**Potential Approaches:**
1. **Heritage Pools** - Aggregate payments to avoid contributor explosion
2. **Depth Limits** - Only allow remixing up to certain generation
3. **Fixed Fees** - Flat payment instead of percentage-based splits

**Decision:** Not yet designed - focus on Gen 1 for alpha
