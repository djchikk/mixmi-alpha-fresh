## 💿 IP Attribution & Rights Management

### Attribution Framework

The platform implements a comprehensive IP attribution system that ensures creators receive proper credit and compensation for their work:

```
Track Attribution
├── Composition Rights (50% of total)
│   ├── Melody creation
│   ├── Lyrical content
│   └── Harmonic structure
└── Production Rights (50% of total)
    ├── Sound design

    └── Technical execution
```

### Remix Attribution

The platform handles remix attribution with sophisticated calculation logic:

#### **Remix Allocation**

- **80% proportional reduction** of original splits
- **Preservation of original attribution** ratios
- **Automatic split recalculation**

#### **Example Remix Attribution**
```
Original Track: "Summer Vibes"
Composition: Artist A (100%)
Production: Artist B (60%), Artist C (40%)

Remix: "Summer Vibes (Dance Mix)"
Composition: Artist A (80%), Remixer (20%)
Production: Artist B (48%), Artist C (32%), Remixer (20%)
