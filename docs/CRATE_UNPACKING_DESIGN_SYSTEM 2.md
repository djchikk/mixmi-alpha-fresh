# 📦 Crate Unpacking Design System - September 8, 2025

**Purpose**: Define how loop packs and EPs behave when dragged to the crate  
**Context**: Professional DJ workflow needs vs content organization  
**Designer**: CC #2 (Project Manager) with deep main app architecture understanding

## 🎯 **Core Design Philosophy**

### **🎛️ The DJ Workflow Problem:**
- **DJs need individual loops** for creative mixing (kick from pack A + vocal from pack B)
- **DJs need individual songs** for seamless transitions (intro → main → outro)  
- **But crate shouldn't be cluttered** with 15+ individual items from multiple packs
- **Artist intent preserved** - packs represent curated collections

### **✨ Solution: Smart Auto-Unpacking by Content Type**

**🔄 Loop Packs → AUTO-UNPACK** (for mixer creativity)  
**🎤 EPs/Songs → STAY PACKED** (for purchase flow)

---

## 🎛️ **Drag-to-Crate Behavior Matrix**

### **🔄 LOOP PACKS (Auto-Unpack for Mixing)**

**User Action:** Drag loop pack from globe to crate  
**System Response:** Auto-unpack into individual loops  
**Crate Result:** 5 separate loop cards (individually draggable to mixer)  

```
BEFORE (Globe):
[🎵 Bass Pack (5 loops)] ← Single thick purple card

AFTER (Crate):
[🥁 Kick] [🎸 Bass Line] [🎹 Melody] [🎺 Horn] [🎻 Strings]
↑ 5 individual 64px cards, ready for mixer creativity
```

**Visual Grouping:** Subtle color coding or label to show pack origin

### **🎤 EPs (Stay Packed for Purchase)**

**User Action:** Drag EP from globe to crate  
**System Response:** Keep as single unit  
**Crate Result:** Single EP card (for purchase workflow)  

```
BEFORE (Globe):
[🎤 Summer EP (3 songs)] ← Single thick gold card

AFTER (Crate):  
[🎤 Summer EP (3 songs)] ← Same thick gold card (purchase-focused)
```

**Interaction:** Click → Purchase flow (not mixer loading)

### **🎵 Individual Content (Direct Transfer)**

**Songs/Individual Loops:** Direct 1:1 transfer to crate

```
Individual Loop: [🔄 Vocal Loop] → [🔄 Vocal Loop] (to mixer)
Individual Song: [🎯 Hit Single] → [🎯 Hit Single] (to purchase)
```

---

## 💻 **Technical Implementation**

### **Crate State Architecture:**
```typescript
interface CrateItem {
  id: string;
  originalType: 'loop' | 'loop_pack' | 'full_song' | 'ep'; // Original content type
  currentType: 'individual' | 'pack'; // How it exists in crate
  parentPackId?: string; // For unpacked items, reference to original pack
  packGrouping?: string; // Visual grouping identifier for unpacked items
  
  // Standard track data
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  audioUrl: string;
  coverUrl: string;
  bpm?: number;
  
  // Purchase/interaction data
  price: number;
  canGoToMixer: boolean; // true for loops, false for songs/EPs
  purchaseFlow: 'individual' | 'pack'; // How purchase works
}
```

### **Drag Handler Logic:**
```typescript
const handleDragToCrate = (item: TrackNode) => {
  switch (item.content_type) {
    case 'loop_pack':
      // AUTO-UNPACK: Convert pack into individual loops
      const unpackedLoops = item.packContent.map((loop, index) => ({
        id: `${item.id}-loop-${index}`,
        originalType: 'loop_pack',
        currentType: 'individual',
        parentPackId: item.id,
        packGrouping: item.title, // "Bass Pack" grouping
        canGoToMixer: true, // Loops can go to mixer
        purchaseFlow: 'individual', // Or maybe 'pack' - depends on business logic
        ...loop
      }));
      
      addToCrate(unpackedLoops);
      showToast(`${item.title} unpacked → ${unpackedLoops.length} loops added to crate`);
      break;
      
    case 'ep':
    case 'full_song':
      // KEEP PACKED: Songs and EPs stay as single items
      const packedItem = {
        id: item.id,
        originalType: item.content_type,
        currentType: 'pack',
        canGoToMixer: false, // Songs can't go to mixer
        purchaseFlow: item.content_type === 'ep' ? 'pack' : 'individual',
        ...item
      };
      
      addToCrate([packedItem]);
      showToast(`${item.title} added to crate`);
      break;
      
    case 'loop':
      // DIRECT: Individual loops go straight to crate
      addToCrate([{...item, canGoToMixer: true, purchaseFlow: 'individual'}]);
      break;
  }
};
```

### **Crate Display Logic:**
```tsx
// Visual grouping for unpacked items
const getPackGroupStyle = (item: CrateItem) => {
  if (item.parentPackId) {
    return {
      border: '1px dashed rgba(151, 114, 244, 0.3)', // Subtle purple dashing
      borderRadius: '4px'
    };
  }
  return {};
};

// Interaction options based on content
const getCrateActions = (item: CrateItem) => {
  if (item.canGoToMixer) {
    return ['drag_to_mixer', 'purchase'];
  } else {
    return ['purchase_only'];
  }
};
```

## 🎨 **UX Benefits**

### **🎛️ For DJs (Loop Packs):**
- ✅ **Creative freedom** - Individual loops immediately available
- ✅ **No extra clicks** - Auto-unpack saves time in workflow
- ✅ **Visual grouping** - Can still see pack relationships
- ✅ **Mixer ready** - Direct drag from crate to decks

### **💰 For Purchasers (Songs/EPs):**
- ✅ **Clean purchase flow** - EP stays as complete unit
- ✅ **Proper pricing** - EP total price vs individual song prices
- ✅ **Artist intent** - EP purchased as curated collection
- ✅ **No mixer confusion** - Clear that songs aren't for mixing

---

## 📊 **Business Logic Considerations**

### **🔄 Loop Pack Purchase:**
**Question:** When user buys individual loop from unpacked pack, do they:
- **A)** Pay individual loop price → Own just that loop
- **B)** Pay full pack price → Own entire pack  
- **C)** Option to buy individual vs full pack

### **💡 Recommendation:** 
**Hybrid approach** - Individual loops available for mixer, but purchase flow offers:
- "Buy this loop: 2.5 STX" 
- "Buy full pack: 8 STX (save 40%)"

---

## 🚀 **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1 (Current Alpha):**
- ✅ **Visual systems working** (thick borders, badges)
- ✅ **Upload workflows** functional for both loop packs and EPs
- ✅ **Globe display** shows content correctly

### **Phase 2 (Pre-Main App):**
- 🔧 **Implement auto-unpacking** logic for loop packs
- 🎨 **Visual grouping** for unpacked loop collections  
- 💰 **Purchase flow** decisions (individual vs pack pricing)

### **Phase 3 (Main App Integration):**
- 🎛️ **Mixer integration** - Crate → deck loading
- 📦 **Purchase integration** - Crate → commerce workflow
- 🔄 **State management** - Complex interactions between components
