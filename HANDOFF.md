# Development Handoff - STX Payment Integration Debugging

## Current Issue
User is unable to see updated payment code in browser despite multiple attempts to clear cache and restart dev server.

## What We're Trying to Test
STX payment integration in the shopping cart (`components/shared/Crate.tsx`). When user clicks "Purchase All", it should:
1. Show console log: `üõí Purchase All clicked!` with auth details
2. Display a payment modal
3. Trigger Stacks wallet transaction via `openSTXTransfer`

## What User Is Seeing
- OLD console log: `üõí Purchasing cart:` (from previous version)
- No modal appearing
- Code is NOT updating in browser despite all refresh attempts

## Code Location
**File**: `components/shared/Crate.tsx`
**Function**: `purchaseAll` (starts at line 255)

Key additions made:
- Lines 6, 14: Import `useAuth` and `openSTXTransfer`
- Lines 123-129: Payment state variables
- Lines 255-308: Complete `purchaseAll` async function with STX transfer
- Lines 1063-1120: Purchase status modal UI

## Troubleshooting Attempts Made
1. ‚úÖ Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. ‚úÖ DevTools "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. ‚úÖ Verified code is saved correctly in file
4. ‚úÖ Restarted dev server multiple times
5. ‚úÖ Cleared `.next` build cache and rebuilt
6. ‚ùå Still seeing old code in browser

## Dependencies Installed
```json
"@stacks/connect": "^8.1.7"
```

## Next Steps to Try
1. **Check for multiple Crate components**: Search if Crate is being imported from wrong location
2. **Check import paths**: Verify where Crate is being imported in pages
3. **Service Worker**: Check if browser has service worker caching the old code
4. **Try incognito/different browser**: Rule out browser-specific caching
5. **Check for build errors**: Look for silent compilation errors
6. **Verify hot reload**: Check if HMR is actually updating the component

## Test Checklist (Once Code Loads)
- [ ] Connect Stacks wallet via header button
- [ ] Add item to cart
- [ ] Click "Purchase All"
- [ ] Verify modal appears
- [ ] Verify wallet prompt appears
- [ ] Test transaction flow

## Context
- Feature branch `feature/big-mixer-integration` was recently merged to main
- Mixer functionality is working correctly
- localStorage persistence is working
- Auth context with Stacks wallet connection is working
- Only this payment flow code update is not reflecting in browser

## User's Setup
- Dev server running on http://localhost:3001
- macOS environment
- Has successfully connected Stacks wallet
- Browser: Not specified, but standard hard refresh not working
