# Development Handoff - STX Payment Integration

## ✅ RESOLVED - Payment Flow Working!

### Root Cause
**Dev server wasn't actually running.** No amount of browser cache clearing would help when the server itself wasn't serving the updated code.

### Solution
1. Killed stale processes
2. Removed `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restarted dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Hard refresh in browser (not incognito - wallet extensions don't work there by default)

### Payment Integration Status: ✅ WORKING

**Successfully tested:**
- ✅ Globe → Cart flow (price_stx correctly passed)
- ✅ Search → Cart flow (price_stx correctly passed)
- ✅ Modal displays with proper states (pending/success/error)
- ✅ Modal dismisses via button or backdrop click
- ✅ Wallet prompt appears with correct STX amount
- ✅ Transaction successfully submits to blockchain
- ✅ Cart clears after successful payment

## Code Location
**File**: `components/shared/Crate.tsx`
**Function**: `purchaseAll` (starts at line 255)

Key additions made:
- Lines 6, 14: Import `useAuth` and `openSTXTransfer`
- Lines 123-129: Payment state variables
- Lines 255-308: Complete `purchaseAll` async function with STX transfer
- Lines 1063-1120: Purchase status modal UI

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Cart Default Price
**File:** `components/shared/Crate.tsx:236`
- Changed default from `'5'` to `'2.5'` STX when track lacks `price_stx`
- Aligns with app-wide 2.5 STX standard

### 2. Modal Dismiss Enhancement
**File:** `components/shared/Crate.tsx:1065-1075`
- Added backdrop click handler to dismiss modal
- Works for success/error states (not pending to prevent accidental cancels)

### 3. Mixer Track Interface
**Files:**
- `components/mixer/types.ts:11` - Added `price_stx?: number` to Track interface
- `contexts/MixerContext.tsx:78` - Preserve `price_stx` in IPTrack → Track conversion
- Ensures price survives mixer-related conversions

## Known Issues - Needs Future Work

### ⚠️ Card Component Inconsistency
**Problem:** 13 different card components with varying `price_stx` handling
- ✅ Globe cards (newer) - correctly pass `price_stx`
- ✅ Search results (newer) - correctly pass `price_stx`
- ❌ Crate drag operations - lose `price_stx` during conversion
- ❓ Other card types - untested

**Card components found:**
```
CompactTrackCard.tsx
CompactTrackCardWithFlip.tsx
GalleryCard.tsx
GlobeTrackCard.tsx ✅ (working)
MediaCard.tsx
OptimizedCompactCard.tsx
OptimizedTrackCard.tsx
ShopCard.tsx
SpotlightCard.tsx
StoreCard.tsx
TrackCard.tsx
+ 2 backup files
```

**Recommendation:** Create new feature branch `feature/card-consolidation` to:
1. Audit which cards are actively used vs legacy
2. Standardize data passing (especially `price_stx`)
3. Merge duplicate functionality
4. Remove unused components

## Dependencies
```json
"@stacks/connect": "^8.1.7"
```

## Current Setup
- Branch: `feature/stx-payment-integration`
- Dev server: http://localhost:3001
- Main app deployed on Vercel from `main` branch
- STX payment integration complete and tested
- Ready to merge or continue with card consolidation work

## Next Development Phase: Card Consolidation

### Proposed Branch: `feature/card-consolidation`

### Analysis Needed:
1. **Map card usage** - Which components are used on which pages?
   - `app/page.tsx` (Globe) - uses ?
   - `app/mixer/page.tsx` - uses ?
   - `app/store/*` - uses ?
   - Search results - uses ?

2. **Identify data flow issues**
   - Where does `price_stx` get lost?
   - Which cards handle drag operations?
   - Which cards integrate with cart properly?

3. **Consolidation strategy**
   - Can we have 1-2 base card components?
   - Use composition patterns for variants?
   - Centralize data transformation logic?

4. **Testing checklist**
   - Cart from all entry points shows correct price
   - Drag & drop preserves all metadata
   - No regressions on existing UI/UX

### Estimated Scope: Medium-Large (8-11 hours)
This is a substantial refactor touching multiple pages and interaction patterns. Should be done carefully with incremental testing.

**See detailed plan:** `CARD-REFACTOR-PLAN.md`

**Recommendation:** Complete on separate branch `feature/card-consolidation`, test thoroughly before merging to main.
