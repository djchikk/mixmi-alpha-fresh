# Gen 1 Remix System - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Core system complete and tested

## What We Built

### 1. IP Split Calculation (`lib/calculateRemixSplits.ts`)
Calculates how IP ownership is distributed when two Gen 0 loops are remixed into a Gen 1 loop.

**Core Logic:**
- Each source loop contributes **50%** to the remix's composition pie
- Each source loop contributes **50%** to the remix's production pie
- Scales each contributor's percentage by 0.5 (100% becomes 50%)
- Consolidates duplicate wallets (same person in multiple roles)
- Adjusts for rounding to ensure exactly 100% totals
- **Remixer is NOT included** in IP splits (they get commission separately)

**Example:**
```
Loop A: Alice (100% comp), Amy (100% prod)
Loop B: Bob (100% comp), Betty (100% prod)

Remix IP Splits:
- Composition: Alice 50%, Bob 50%
- Production: Amy 50%, Betty 50%
- Remixer: Gets 20% commission when someone buys the remix (later)
```

### 2. UI Display (`components/modals/TrackDetailsModal.tsx`)
Shows IP splits in a user-friendly grouped format.

**Features:**
- Groups splits by source loop for clarity
- Shows scaling math: "Creator: 100% → 50% of remix"
- Displays wallet addresses for transparency
- Works for all content types (loops, songs, EPs, loop packs)
- Clear note about remixer commission model

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`scripts/test-remix-splits.ts`)
Automated tests covering edge cases.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Simple baseline** - 1 composer + 1 producer per loop
2. **Multiple contributors** - 3 composers + 2 producers
3. **Same person, multiple roles** - Tests consolidation
4. **Rounding edge cases** - 33%, 51% splits

**Run tests:** `npm run test:remix-splits`
**Result:** All 4 scenarios passing ✅

## Key Business Decisions

### Payment Model (Simplified)
1. **At remix creation:**
   - Remixer pays: **1 STX flat fee**
   - Distribution: 50/50 to source loop creators
   - Remixer gets: Nothing (they're the buyer)

2. **When someone downloads the remix:**
   - Buyer pays: Remix download price
   - Remixer gets: **20% commission** (they're the seller)
   - IP holders get: **80% split** 50/50 between source loops

### Forced Equal Splits
- No negotiation on percentages
- 2 people = 50/50 automatic
- 3 people = 33/33/34 automatic
- Keeps it simple and fair

### Remixer Can Be Contributor
- If remixer contributed to a source loop, they appear in IP splits
- They also get their 20% commission
- Results in TWO separate payments (cleaner for transparency)

## Content Types

### Loops (8-bar)
- Can be remixed infinitely
- Goes in the mixer
- Reusable as source material

### Mixes (any length)
- Creative expression
- Can't be remixed (terminal node)
- Just for listening/showcasing

## What's Next

### For MVP:
- [ ] Simplify PaymentModal (1 STX flat fee only)
- [ ] Remove download options at remix creation
- [ ] Add post-recording trim tool (8-bar vs any-length)
- [ ] Test with real users

### Future Vision:
- [ ] Heritage Pools for Gen 2+ payments
- [ ] Creative genealogy visualization on globe
- [ ] DID system for infinite attribution
- [ ] Playlist/radio monetization
- [ ] Download certificates

## Files to Know

### Core Implementation:
- `lib/calculateRemixSplits.ts` - Calculation logic
- `components/modals/TrackDetailsModal.tsx` - Display UI
- `components/mixer/PaymentModal.tsx` - Payment flow (needs update)

### Testing:
- `scripts/test-remix-splits.ts` - Automated test suite
- `scripts/test-data-setup.sql` - Database test data
- `scripts/test-data-cleanup.sql` - Cleanup script
- `scripts/TEST_SUITE_README.md` - Test documentation

### Documentation:
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Main project documentation
- `CURATION_STRATEGY_QUESTION.md` - Strategic questions for Claude Desktop
- `GEN1_REMIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Testing Checklist

✅ Simple case (1+1 contributors)
✅ Multiple contributors (3+2)
✅ Same person multiple roles
✅ Rounding edge cases
✅ 100% totals validation
✅ Remixer exclusion from IP splits
✅ UI displays correctly
✅ Wallet addresses visible

## Questions Still Open

1. **Gen 2+ payment model** - Heritage Pools or stop payments?
2. **Playlist curation rewards** - Better than remix commission?
3. **Attribution vs payment balance** - Where to draw the line?
4. **Content type strategy** - How to handle mixes vs loops in genealogy?
