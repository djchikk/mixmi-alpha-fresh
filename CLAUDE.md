# CLAUDE.md - Mixmi Alpha Uploader

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Mixmi Alpha Uploader repository.

## Project Overview

**Mixmi Alpha Uploader** is a standalone Next.js application for alpha content migration, built separately from the main Mixmi app to avoid production environment issues. It provides a complete loop pack upload system with 3-way content selection (Song | Loop | Loop Pack).

## üîó **CRITICAL: Main App Integration Context**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is an ALPHA UPLOADER, not the full Mixmi app!**

**Main Mixmi App (in local development) includes:**
1. **üéõÔ∏è Tiny mixer** that floats over the globe for real-time content mixing
2. **üì¶ Persistent crate** at bottom that transports content between app sections with purchase flow
3. **üè™ Content Creator Stores** with individual creator vaults and certificates  
4. **üë§ User profile pages** with complex social and content management features
5. **üîÑ Inter-component interactions** between globe, mixer, crate, stores, and profiles

**Integration Considerations:**
- **Component portability**: Alpha components will be ported to main app
- **State management**: Alpha uses simple state, main app has complex multi-context system  
- **Authentication**: Alpha uses wallet whitelist, main app uses full Stacks Connect
- **Data flow**: Alpha is upload-focused, main app has complex user interactions
- **UI consistency**: Components must work with main app's layout and floating elements

**This alpha uploader serves as a testing ground and component laboratory for features that will eventually integrate into the main Mixmi application ecosystem.**

## Essential Commands

```bash

# Create .env.local with:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_api_key
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 App Router with TypeScript
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Auth**: Stacks blockchain wallet (@stacks/connect)
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with @react-three/fiber
- **State**: React Context with multi-account isolation
- **Storage**: Hybrid localStorage + Supabase cloud
- **Geocoding**: Mapbox API for location coordinates
- **Deployment**: Vercel

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Multi-Account System**: Each Stacks wallet supports multiple creative identities with complete data isolation
2. **Context-Based State**: AuthContext, ProfileContext, MixerContext for different features
3. **Hybrid Storage**: localStorage for fast access, Supabase for persistence with automatic sync
4. **SSR-Safe 3D**: Dynamic imports for Three.js components to avoid SSR issues
