# Handoff Prompt for New Claude Code Teammate

## Quick Context
You're joining a project where we've built Radio Widget and Playlist Widget for a music mixing app. The previous Claude Code instance hit environment issues, so we're starting fresh from a clean clone.

## What's Already Done ‚úÖ
1. **Radio Widget** - Fully working, merged to main
2. **Playlist Widget** - Fully coded, on branch `feature/playlist-widget`
3. **Implementation Guide** - Complete documentation in `AUDIO_WIDGETS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
4. **All code pushed to GitHub** - Safe and ready to use

## Your First Tasks üéØ

### 1. Get the Environment Running
```bash
# You should already be in the fresh project folder
git checkout feature/playlist-widget
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify Both Widgets Load
- Open http://localhost:3001
- Look for **Radio Widget** in lower-right corner
- Look for **Playlist Widget** in lower-left corner
- Both should be draggable and collapsible

### 3. Test Core Functionality
- **Radio**: Click play, should fetch and play random tracks continuously
- **Playlist**: Drag a track from Globe onto it, should add to queue
- **Audio Coordination**: Playing one should pause the other

## If Widgets Don't Appear

**Check 1:** Are they in page.tsx?
```tsx
// Around line 780
<PlaylistWidget />

// Around line 783-785
<div className="fixed bottom-20 right-6 z-30">
  <RadioWidget />
</div>
```

**Check 2:** Are the files there?
- `/components/RadioWidget.tsx` ‚úì
- `/components/PlaylistWidget.tsx` ‚úì

**Check 3:** Any console errors?
- Open browser DevTools
- Look for import errors or DnD provider issues

## Key Architecture Points

### Audio Coordination
All three audio sources (Radio, Playlist, Mixer) use a global event system:
```tsx
// When playing starts
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('audioSourcePlaying', {
  detail: { source: 'radio' } // or 'playlist' or 'mixer'
}));

// Each listens for others
window.addEventListener('audioSourcePlaying', handleOtherAudioPlaying);
```

### Drag-Drop Types
```tsx
// Radio Widget
type: 'RADIO_TRACK'

// Playlist accepts
accept: ['TRACK', 'GLOBE_CARD', 'CRATE_TRACK', 'RADIO_TRACK']

// Playlist items (for reordering)
type: 'PLAYLIST_ITEM'
```

### Smart Playback (Playlist Only)
```tsx
if (track.content_type === 'full_song') {
  // Limit to 20 seconds preview
  if (audio.currentTime >= 20) playNext();
} else {
  // Loops play full length until 'ended' event
}
```

## What We Were Working On

The widgets are **feature-complete** but haven't been tested in a clean environment yet. The previous instance hit build cache corruption after multiple cache clears.

## Next Steps After Verification

If everything loads correctly:
1. Test all drag-drop sources (Globe, Mixer, Crate, Search)
2. Test playlist reordering
3. Test audio coordination between all sources
4. If all works ‚Üí merge `feature/playlist-widget` to main
5. If issues ‚Üí debug using implementation guide

## Resources

1. **Full Implementation Guide**: `AUDIO_WIDGETS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Complete code examples
   - Line-by-line explanations
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **Previous Teammate's Context**: Available in the previous chat
   - Design decisions
   - Styling rationale
   - Why certain approaches were chosen

3. **GitHub Branches**:
   - `main` - Has Radio Widget working
   - `feature/playlist-widget` - Has both widgets + implementation doc

## Communication Style

The user (Sandy) prefers:
- **Concise responses** - Get to the point
- **Show, don't explain** - Code changes over lengthy explanations
- **Proactive problem-solving** - Fix issues as you find them
- **Collaborative approach** - "Let's try X" rather than "You should do X"

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT**:
- Create new implementations from scratch (code already exists!)
- Modify working Radio Widget unless specifically asked
- Push directly to main (use feature branch workflow)

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Use the existing code in `feature/playlist-widget` branch
- Read `AUDIO_WIDGETS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed context
- Test thoroughly before merging
- Ask Sandy for clarification if anything is unclear

## Success Criteria

You'll know you're successful when:
1. ‚úÖ Dev server runs without errors
2. ‚úÖ Both widgets appear on Globe page
3. ‚úÖ Radio plays random tracks continuously
4. ‚úÖ Playlist accepts drops from all sources
5. ‚úÖ Tracks can be reordered in playlist
6. ‚úÖ Loops play full length, songs preview 20 seconds
7. ‚úÖ Only one audio source plays at a time
8. ‚úÖ All features work as documented

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch

# Switch to playlist branch
git checkout feature/playlist-widget

# See what's changed
git status
git diff main

# If you need to start completely fresh
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run dev

# Kill stuck dev servers
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```
