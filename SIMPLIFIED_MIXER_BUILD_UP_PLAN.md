# SimplifiedMixer Build-Up Strategy

## üéØ Mission
Build UP from the working SimplifiedMixer by incrementally adding features from MixerPage, one at a time, testing after each addition. This is safer and more predictable than debugging the complex MixerPage.

**Date:** September 26, 2025
**Current Status:** SimplifiedMixer working perfectly at /mixer route
**Strategy:** Incremental feature addition with testing between each step

## üéÅ What MixerPage Has That SimplifiedMixer Doesn't

### 1. FX Processing System ‚≠ê (Priority 1)
**Component:** `FXComponent.tsx` (1,100 lines)
**Location:** Ready to integrate, fully self-contained
**Features:**
- Filter effect (highpass/lowpass with resonance)
- Delay + Reverb effect (integrated)
- XY pad control for parameters
- Power buttons to enable/disable effects
- Effect selector buttons
- Performance optimization (60fps throttling)
- Synthetic reverb fallback

**Integration Points:**
- Requires: AudioContext, deck ID
- Exposes: `audioInput` and `audioOutput` nodes
- Audio routing: `source ‚Üí filterNode ‚Üí [FX] ‚Üí gainNode ‚Üí analyzer`
- Already used in MixerPage (lines 263-329, 468-535)

**How MixerPage Uses It:**
```typescript
// Refs for FX components
const deckAFXRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const deckBFXRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

// Render FX components
<FXComponent
  ref={deckAFXRef}
  audioContext={getAudioContext()}
  deckId="deckA"
/>

// Connect to audio chain when track loads
if (deckAFXRef.current) {
  const fxInput = (deckAFXRef.current as any).audioInput;
  const fxOutput = (deckAFXRef.current as any).audioOutput;
  audioState.filterNode.connect(fxInput);
  fxOutput.connect(audioState.gainNode);
}
```

---

### 2. Deck Crates (2√ó2 Track Queues) ‚≠ê (Priority 2)
**Component:** `DeckCrate.tsx` (518 lines)
**Location:** Ready to integrate
**Features:**

- Empty state with dotted border
- Overflow indicator (+N)

**Integration Points:**
- Uses: MixerContext (deckACrate, deckBCrate, addTrackToCrate, removeTrackFromCrate)
- Props: `deck`, `currentTrack`, `loading`
- Fully self-contained component

**How MixerPage Uses It:**
```typescript
// Render deck crates
<DeckCrate
  deck="A"
  currentTrack={mixerState.deckA.track}
  loading={mixerState.deckA.loading}
/>
```

**Layout in MixerPage:**
```
[Deck A] [Crate A] --- [Master BPM] --- [Crate B] [Deck B]
```

```typescript
// Recording toggle handler
const handleRecordToggle = async () => {
  const audioContext = await getAudioContext();
  const masterGain = getMasterGain();
  const currentBPM = mixerState.deckA.playing ? mixerState.deckA.track.bpm : mixerState.masterBPM;

  mixerRecorder.startRecording({
    bars: 64,
    bpm: currentBPM,
    audioContext,
    sourceNode: masterGain
  }).then(result => {
    setRecordingPreview({
      url: result.url,
      duration: result.duration,
      bars: result.bars,
      bpm: currentBPM
    });
  });
};

// Render recording preview modal
{recordingPreview && (
  <RecordingPreview
    recordingUrl={recordingPreview.url}
    duration={recordingPreview.duration}
    bars={recordingPreview.bars}
    bpm={recordingPreview.bpm}
    deckATrack={mixerState.deckA.track}

## üìã Incremental Build-Up Plan

### Phase 1: Add FX Processing ‚≠ê (Highest Value)
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes
**Risk:** Low - FX component is self-contained

#### Steps:
1. **Import FX Component**
   ```typescript
   import FXComponent from './FXComponent';
   ```

2. **Add FX Refs to SimplifiedMixer**
   ```typescript
   const deckAFXRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

   ```

3. **Update Layout to Include FX Panels**
   - Add FX panels on left (Deck A) and right (Deck B) sides
   - Keep waveforms in center
   - Use grid layout similar to MixerPage

4. **Render FX Components**
   ```typescript
   <FXComponent
     ref={deckAFXRef}
     audioContext={getAudioContext()}
     deckId="deckA"
   />
   ```

5. **Connect FX to Audio Chain**
   - Copy connection logic from MixerPage (lines 263-329)
   - Insert FX between filterNode and gainNode
   - Add retry logic for timing issues

6. **Test:**
   - Load tracks to both decks
   - Verify FX controls work
   - Verify audio routing is correct
   - Check for audio dropouts

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ FX panels render on both sides
- ‚úÖ Filter effect works (cutoff, resonance)
- ‚úÖ Delay effect works (time, feedback)
- ‚úÖ XY pad is responsive
- ‚úÖ Power buttons enable/disable effects
- ‚úÖ No audio dropouts or clicks

#### Steps:
1. **Import DeckCrate Component**
   ```typescript
   import DeckCrate from './DeckCrate';
   ```

2. **Update Layout**
   - Position crates next to decks (like MixerPage)
   - Left side: Deck A + Crate A
   - Right side: Crate B + Deck B

3. **Render DeckCrate Components**
   ```typescript
   <DeckCrate
     deck="A"
     currentTrack={mixerState.deckA.track}
     loading={mixerState.deckA.loading}
   />
   ```

4. **Test:**
   - Drag tracks from collection to crates
   - Drag tracks from crates to decks
   - Verify audition works (click to preview)
   - Verify right-click removes tracks
   - Check loading overlay appears during track load

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Crates render next to decks
- ‚úÖ Drag & drop works

2. **Initialize State with Persistence**
   ```typescript
   const [mixerState, setMixerState] = useState<SimplifiedMixerState>(() => {
     return loadMixerState() || getDefaultMixerState();
   });
   ```

3. **Auto-Save on State Changes**
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     saveMixerState(mixerState);
   }, [mixerState]);
   ```

4. **Add Clear State Button (Optional)**

5. **Test:**
   - Load tracks, change settings
   - Refresh page
   - Verify settings restored
   - Verify audio doesn't auto-play

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ State persists across page reloads
