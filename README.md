> **Current Status:** Alpha content migration tool for global music discovery via interactive 3D globe interface

A specialized Next.js application for alpha content migration to the broader Mixmi creator economy platform. Features a stunning 3D globe interface for geographic music discovery and a streamlined loop pack upload system for alpha users.

## 🌍 Core Features

### 🎯 Interactive 3D Globe Discovery
- **Geographic Music Visualization** - Explore music positioned worldwide on an interactive 3D globe
- **Smart Clustering** - Locations within 200-mile radius cluster for better UX (keeps LA/SF separate)
- **Real-time Audio Previews** - 20-second track previews directly from globe nodes
- **Advanced Hover System** - Track information and tags appear on hover
- **Content Comparison** - Side-by-side track comparison with floating cards

### 📦 Professional Loop Pack System
- **Multi-File Uploads** - Upload 2-5 audio files as cohesive loop packs
- **Content Type Detection** - Automatic categorization (Song | Loop | Loop Pack)
- **Visual Distinction** - Loop packs display with distinctive thick purple borders
- **Detailed Modal Views** - Individual loop audition and metadata within packs
- **BPM Management** - Required user input for loops/packs (detection available but user override essential for mixer compatibility)

### 🔐 Alpha User Authentication
- **Whitelist-Based Access** - Simplified authentication via alpha user verification
- **Stacks Wallet Integration** - Mainnet wallet address authentication
- **No Complex Auth Flow** - Streamlined paste-address-and-upload experience
- **Multi-Contributor Support** - Only uploader needs alpha approval for collaborations

### 🎧 Professional Audio Processing
- **Advanced Upload Pipeline** - 5-stage processing with real-time feedback
- **Audio Compression** - Intelligent format optimization for web delivery
- **Waveform Visualization** - Professional canvas-based audio visualization
- **Clean Audio Management** - Automatic cleanup and 20-second preview limits

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Stacks blockchain wallet integration
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with @react-three/fiber for globe rendering
- **Storage**: Supabase cloud storage with hybrid local caching
- **Geocoding**: Mapbox API for worldwide location coordinates
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations

### Key Components
- **3D Globe** (`components/globe/`) - Interactive world visualization with clustering
- **Upload System** (`hooks/useIPTrackSubmit.ts`) - Multi-file loop pack processing
- **Audio Engine** (`lib/mixerAudio.ts`) - Professional audio processing and BPM detection
- **Track Cards** (`components/cards/CompactTrackCard.tsx`) - Unified track display system
- **Modal System** (`components/modals/`) - Upload and track detail interfaces

### Storage Architecture
- **User Content Bucket** - Supabase storage for audio files and cover art
- **Account-Specific Organization** - Data isolated by wallet address
- **Hybrid Caching** - localStorage for performance + cloud for persistence
- **Smart Compression** - Multiple quality levels for optimal delivery

## 🎵 Content Management

### Supported Content Types
- **Songs** - Complete tracks with gold accent borders
- **Loops** - Individual music loops with purple accent borders  
- **Loop Packs** - Multi-file collections with thick purple borders

### Upload Flow
1. **Alpha Verification** - Paste Stacks wallet address for whitelist check
2. **Content Selection** - Choose Song, Loop, or Loop Pack upload type
3. **File Upload** - Select audio files via file picker (10MB limit each)
4. **Metadata Entry** - Title, artist, BPM, location, and attribution details
5. **Processing** - 5-stage pipeline with real-time progress feedback
6. **Globe Integration** - Content immediately appears positioned on globe

### BPM Requirements
- **Loops & Loop Packs** - BPM input is required (not optional)
- **Loop Pack Consistency** - All individual loops within a pack must have matching BPM
- **User Override Priority** - Manual BPM entry supersedes automatic detection
- **Mixer Compatibility** - User-provided whole number BPM prevents decimal precision issues in mixer

### Geographic Integration
- **Worldwide Support** - Mapbox geocoding for any location globally
- **Indigenous Territory Recognition** - Support for tribal lands and nations
- **Smart Clustering** - Regional grouping while maintaining local distinctness
- **Visual Positioning** - Content appears precisely positioned on 3D globe
